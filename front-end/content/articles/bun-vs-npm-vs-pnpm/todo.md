# TODO

* do fact checking
* check one more time installation performance commparison numbers. Are those really available?
* Add comparison of bun, npm and pnpm typical commands. If available, also build, release and other scripts.
* update article links if necessary
* are any security checks dependency checks available?
* migration steps from npm to bun
* add a focused section to compare pnpm and bun. Does it make sense for a monorepo maintainers, when bun is not used as a JS runtime?
* check the built-in support of TS transpiler
* specify structure of package.json, package-lock.json or any other special configuration file and why is it better than in traditional npm?
* specify structure of node_modules if applicable
* specify structure of cache, offline, stores, catalogs or anything specific to a package manager and why is it better than in traditional npm?
