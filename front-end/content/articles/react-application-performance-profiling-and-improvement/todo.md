# TODO List

## Hints
* https://www.developerway.com/posts/i-tried-react-compiler

- [ ] Idea of the article
    * test different component combinations with a local state handler with help of a test React18/NextJS14 static web app
    * see, what happens with React 19RC/NextJS 15RC and the new compiler
 - [ ] Situations, which I want to try
 - [ ] Test application structure and pages
 - [ ] Show all situations and explain each case
 - [ ] What if I upgrade to React19 and NextJS15? Nothing really :)
    * upgrade without compiler and check all debugger outputs
 - [ ] Oh, wait... There is a new compiler. Holly shit! It is cool
    * add the new compiler and check all debugger outputs
 - [ ] Conclusions
