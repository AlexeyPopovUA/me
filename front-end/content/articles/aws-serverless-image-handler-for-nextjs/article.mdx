## Why

Before learning about Next.js I was pretty much happy with Gatsby.js and the way it offered you support of responsive images for an exported static website. You should not think how and where those images are resized during the build. You simply get all processed images in the distribution directory after the build, which should be uploaded to the storage of static web hosting. That's it. Gatsby takes care of the rest - creation of resized versions, injecting image URLs with different sizes into HTML code, adding tiny blurred versions for loading state. Everything was fine until I realized, that Gatsby.js becomes less popular and looses the maintenance activity. Next.js became a standard for many web projects and often required in job vacancies. I planned to develop a new personal website, so decided to do it with Next.js and learn a new popular framework at the same time. The biggest surprise was, that you cannot get responsive images that easy in an exported static website. Either non-optimized images or remote ones have to be used.

Long story short. This article offers one of many ways to get a self-hosted image optimization service that provides an exported static Next.js website with images and blurred versions of those.

## How

The cheapest image optimization solution that I could completely control and reverse engineer in case of need was [Serverless Image Handler on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/serverless-image-handler/), available in  [AWS Solutions Library](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/).
